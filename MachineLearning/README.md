# Machine Learning Repository

## Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is about teaching a machine to recognize patterns from data and make predictions or decisions based on it. It is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables models to learn from data instead of following explicitly programmed rules.

---

## Types of Programming

### 1️⃣ Traditional Programming
In traditional programming, humans define the rules, and the computer follows them.
```
Input --> Logic (Rules) --> Output
```
Example: To calculate the area of a rectangle:
```
Area = Length * Width
```

### 2️⃣ Machine Learning Programming
In Machine Learning, the machine learns rules from data.
```
Input (Data) --> Logic (Learned from data) --> Output
```
Example: Predicting the area of a rectangle using past data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning
The machine learns from labeled data (data with inputs and corresponding outputs).
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Applications:** Spam filtering, medical diagnosis, fraud detection

### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning
The machine learns patterns from unlabeled data (only inputs without outputs).
- **Algorithms:** K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Applications:** Market segmentation, anomaly detection

### 3️⃣ Semi-Supervised Learning
Combines labeled and unlabeled data for training.
- **Applications:** Text and image recognition

### 4️⃣ Reinforcement Learning
The machine learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties).
- **Algorithms:** Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks
- **Applications:** Game playing, robotics, resource management

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model with labeled data, consisting of input features and corresponding output labels.

### 🔹 Types of Supervised Learning
#### 1️⃣ Classification
- **Used for:** Predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam)
- **Examples:** Email filtering, disease prediction
- **Algorithms:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes

#### 2️⃣ Regression
- **Used for:** Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature)
- **Examples:** Predicting house prices, forecasting stock prices
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

---

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning involves finding patterns in data without labeled outputs.

### 🔹 Types of Unsupervised Learning
#### 1️⃣ Clustering
- **Used for:** Grouping data points based on similarity
- **Algorithms:** K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models
- **Applications:** Market segmentation, customer profiling

## Data Collection Methods
Several ways exist to collect data for machine learning models:

1. **APIs** (e.g., Twitter API for collecting tweets)
   - ✅ Structured data, easy access
   - ❌ Rate limits, API key requirements
2. **Web Scraping** (Using BeautifulSoup or Scrapy)
   - ✅ Access to non-API data
   - ❌ Legal and ethical issues
3. **Webhooks** (Real-time data collection)
   - Example: GitHub Webhooks to track commits
4. **Public Datasets** (Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, World Bank Data)
   - ✅ Free, reliable
   - ❌ Preprocessing may be required

## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique to detect the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in text.

### 🔹 Applications
- Customer feedback analysis
- Market research
- Brand monitoring

### 🔹 Process
1. Collect reviews using APIs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)
2. Analyze sentiment using ML models
3. Classify text as **positive, negative, or neutral**

### 🔹 Tools
- TextBlob
- VADER
- Transformers
