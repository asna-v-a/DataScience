#Rules for creating variables

num1 = 10
# num2 = 20 - Indentation matters , Space not supported at beginning

#company name = 'Luminar' - Space not supported in between, use underscore instead eg:company_name

#2num = 20 - Numbers, special characters except underscore(_) are not supported at beginning

#Keywords can't be used as identifies Eg: for, while, do, pass, print, if, else, elif, input, break, continue, etc.

num = 10
Num = 10
NUM = 10 # Variables are case sensitive


age = 20
age = 25 # Not an error, but the last assignment will be taken (25 will be taken as age value)

# Always use a noun. Give corresponding names to variables as num, name, age, salary, etc. rather than a, b, c,...


#declare variables in single line
a,b,c,d,e = 10,20,30,40,50
