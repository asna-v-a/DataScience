# Tuples

#1. Define Tuple
tu = () # Empty tuple

tu1 = tuple() # tuple using function, used to change other collections to tuple --> tuple(set_name)

tu2 = (10,10.5,10,20,20,20.5,1234567890,True,False,'bigdata','python')
print(tu)
print(tu1)
print(tu2)
print(tu2[4])#Index : start with 0 and ends with n-1 , used to get a particular element in tuple

#2. Heterogeneous data
#3. It supports duplicate values
#4. Insertion order is preserved
#5. It's Immutable
