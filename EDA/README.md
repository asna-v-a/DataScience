# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science pipeline. It involves summarizing the dataset, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and forming hypotheses through visual and statistical methods.

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to EDA** - Understanding the purpose and importance of EDA.
2. **Data Collection** - Methods to acquire and load data from various sources.
3. **Data Cleaning** - Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
4. **Data Visualization** - Using plots and graphs to explore data.
5. **Statistical Analysis** - Applying descriptive and inferential statistics.
6. **Feature Engineering** - Creating new features to enhance models.
7. **Outlier Detection** - Identifying and handling anomalies in the dataset.
8. **Correlation Analysis** - Understanding relationships between variables.
9. **Dimensionality Reduction** - Reducing dataset complexity using PCA, t-SNE, etc.
10. **EDA with Python Libraries** - Using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
