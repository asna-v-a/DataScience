# DataScience 

Welcome to the **DataScience** repository! This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Science** from scratch. I started with **Python**, covering its basics to advanced concepts, and progressively moved to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **PythonDS/** - Covers Python from basics to advanced concepts, specifically tailored for data science.
- **EDA/** - Hands-on Exploratory Data Analysis techniques using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **ML/** - Covers fundamental machine learning algorithms and concepts.

## 🔥 Topics Covered
✅ Python Basics to Advanced  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Machine Learning (ML) - Supervised & Unsupervised  
🔜 Deep Learning  

## 🎯 Goal
This repository serves as a learning resource for me and anyone else looking to start **Data Science** from scratch. Contributions and suggestions are welcome! 🤝

## 📌 How to Use?
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
